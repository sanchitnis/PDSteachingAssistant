# REVA C Tutor

**AI-powered Socratic teaching assistant for C programming — REVA University, School of CSE**

---

## What This Is

A VS Code–integrated system that assigns C programming exercises, guides students through debugging via Socratic questioning, and grades submissions against a 10-point rubric — **without ever giving them the answer**.

The agent asks questions that make students find bugs themselves. This builds the mental execution model that separates programmers from typists.

## Quick Start (Students)

See **`docs/how_to_use.md`** for the full guide. Short version:

```bash
# 1. Install tools (Ubuntu/WSL)
sudo apt install gcc cppcheck jq python3
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# 2. Register yourself
./scripts/init_student.sh raj22cs045 "Raj Kumar" "BTech-CS-2B"

# 3. Get your first exercise
./scripts/next.sh raj22cs045
# → creates INTRO_L1_a_raj22cs045.c

# 4. Write your solution, then get help
./scripts/help.sh INTRO_L1_a_raj22cs045.c
# → paste the output into Claude chat

# 5. Submit for grading
./scripts/grade.sh INTRO_L1_a_raj22cs045.c
# → paste the output into Claude chat
```

## Agent Architecture

```
Student pastes context block
          │
          ▼
    SKILL.md (router)
     /           \
    HELP          GRADE
     │              │
help_agent.md  grade_agent.md
(Socratic       (10-point
 protocol)       rubric)
```

**Token efficiency design**: The master `SKILL.md` is ~250 tokens. Only the relevant specialist agent is loaded per invocation (~500 tokens). The full 1300-line spec is never loaded during normal operation.

## Syllabus Coverage (8 Units, 20 Topics)

| Unit | Topics |
|---|---|
| 1 — Basics | INTRO, DTYPES, OPS, IO |
| 2 — Control Flow | COND, LOOP, JUMP |
| 3 — Functions | FUNC, SCOPE, RECUR |
| 4 — Arrays & Strings | ARRAY, STRING |
| 5 — Pointers | PTR, PTRARR, PTRF |
| 6 — Structures | STRUCT, UNION, ENUM |
| 7 — File I/O | FILE |
| 8 — Dynamic Memory | DYNMEM |

Topics unlock progressively: a unit must be mastered (demonstrated_level=3 for all topics) before the next unit's topics become available.
